# Creating a WordPress Site from Scratch

## Working Philosophy

This process is built on a fundamental principle: **always ask before acting**. Never invent content, don't choose plugins without consulting the user, and don't make design decisions without asking first. The user knows their business better than anyone; your job is to guide them with clear options and execute their decisions professionally.

Each phase includes the questions you must ask. Do not advance to the next phase without clear answers. If something is ambiguous, ask again.
