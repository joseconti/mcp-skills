Create legal pages with base text, always indicating that **they must be reviewed by a legal professional**.

### Preliminary Questions

1. Company name or site owner's name.
2. Tax ID / Business registration number.
3. Physical address of the responsible party.
4. Contact email.
5. Are personal data collected through forms? (contact, registration, purchase)
6. Are third-party cookies used? (Analytics, social media, advertising)
7. Under which legislation does it operate? (GDPR, local data protection laws, etc.)

### Pages to Create

1. **Legal Notice** — Owner, site purpose, intellectual property, limitation of liability.
2. **Privacy Policy** — Data controller, data collected, purposes, legal basis, recipients, user rights, retention period.
3. **Cookie Policy** — What cookies are, types used, purpose, management, link to the banner settings panel.
4. **Terms and Conditions** (especially for e-commerce) — Terms of use, purchase, shipping, returns, warranties.

Always include this visible notice on each legal page: *"This text is for guidance purposes and must be reviewed by a legal professional to ensure regulatory compliance."*

Configure SEO for each legal page. Ask whether they should be set to noindex.
