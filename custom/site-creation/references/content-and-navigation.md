# Phases 8–9: Site Pages & Navigation Menu

## Phase 8 — Site Pages

### Required Pages (minimum)

1. **Homepage** — Ask what content they want to highlight. Create a structure with sections based on the site type. Featured image + complete SEO.

2. **About Us** — Ask for company/person information and whether they want photos. Featured image + complete SEO.

3. **Contact** — Include the form (from the Phase 5 plugin). Ask if they want a map, what data to display (address, phone, email, hours). Featured image + complete SEO.

4. **Blog** (if applicable) — Create the page and assign it as the posts page. Ask whether to create sample posts.

### Additional Pages

Ask: "Do you need any other pages? For example: Services, Projects, FAQ, Testimonials, Team, Pricing..."

### For Each Page Created

- Consult the user about the content.
- Create a featured image (with Gemini).
- If the user authorized content images, create those as well.
- Fill in all SEO fields.
- Set alt text on all images.
