## Phase 4 — SEO Plugin

SEO is installed **before creating any content** because every page, post, or product created must have complete SEO from the start. If you create content first, you'll have to go back and review everything later.

### Process

1. Offer alternatives: Yoast SEO, Rank Math, SEOPress, All in One SEO (AIOSEO).
2. Ask which they prefer. You can guide them: "Rank Math is very comprehensive and popular, Yoast is the classic choice."
3. Install, activate, and run the basic configuration:
   - Initial setup wizard
   - Site title and separator
   - Content types to index
   - Social metadata (Open Graph)
   - XML Sitemap
   - Robots.txt

4. **Permanent rule:** From this point on, every page/post/product you create must have:
   - Optimized SEO title
   - Meta description
   - Clean, optimized slug
   - Alt text on all images
